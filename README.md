## i. Introduction
This document provides technical documentation of the migration process from an **Oracle VirtualBox virtual machine** to an **EasyStack environment** using **Hystax**.  

The purpose of this migration was to validate the feasibility of replicating workloads from a local virtualization environment to a cloud-based infrastructure while preserving functionality.  

The test workload involved deploying and serving a static web page through **Nginx**, which served as a baseline service to confirm successful replication.  

The report captures the steps required to configure the environment, prepare the system for migration, and execute replication through the Hystax platform.

---

## ii. Methodology

The migration was conducted in three primary phases:

1. **Virtual Machine Preparation**  
   - Configured VM in Oracle VirtualBox.  
   - Installed and tested Nginx for service delivery.  
   - Resolved networking via NAT and port forwarding.  

2. **System Preparation for Replication**  
   - Verified Linux kernel version.  
   - Installed kernel headers, DKMS, and build tools.  
   - Installed the Hystax replication agent.  

3. **Replication and Migration via Hystax**  
   - Initiated replication in Hystax Management Console.  
   - Created migration plan.  
   - Deployed migrated VM in EasyStack environment.

## 1. Initial Setup on Oracle VirtualBox

### 1.1 Nginx Installation & Configuration
```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update
# Install Nginx
sudo apt install nginx -y
# Start and enable Nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
# Verify Nginx status
sudo systemctl status nginx
````

Retrieve VM IP:

```bash
ip a
```

Returned: `inet 10.0.2.15/24`.
Direct access failed due to NAT configuration.

### 1.2 Network Adjustment with NAT and Port Forwarding

VirtualBox ‚Üí **Settings ‚Üí Network ‚Üí NAT ‚Üí Port Forwarding**

| Host IP   | Host Port | Guest IP  | Guest Port |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 127.0.0.1 | 8080      | 10.0.2.15 | 80         |

### 1.3 Uploading HTML Content

```bash
sudo cp /media/sf_file/web-asg-file.html /var/www/html/
sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/web-asg-file.html
```

Verified at:

```

## 2. Migration via Hystax

### 2.1 Download Agents

Steps performed in **Hystax Management Console**:

1. **Customer Creation** ‚Üí Created new account under my name.

2. **Customer Selection** ‚Üí Selected newly created account.

3. **Agent Type** ‚Üí Chose **Internal Agent (Linux)**.

4. **Agent Settings** ‚Üí Configured machine identification, network subnet, and IP mapping.

5. **Kernel Compatibility**

   ```bash
   uname -r
   ```

   Result: `6.8.0-71-generic` ‚Üí Required DKMS since prebuilt module unavailable.

6. **Replication Instructions** ‚Üí Installed DKMS, headers, and dependencies.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install dkms perl make gcc libelf-dev \
   linux-headers-$(uname -r) linux-headers-generic
   sudo dpkg -i hlragent.deb
   ```

---

### 2.2 Replication and Migration Execution

1. In **Machines tab** ‚Üí Waited until VM detected ‚Üí Started replication.

   * Status progressed to **Synced**.

2. In **Migration Plans tab** ‚Üí Created migration plan with configuration below:

| Parameter         | Value                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Flavor**        | 2C-4G (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM)              |
| **Port Name**     | port\_0                               |
| **Port Subnet**   | ACME\_network\_default\_ipv4\_subnet  |
| **Port IP**       | 10.0.2.15 (NAT IP in VirtualBox)      |
| **Target Subnet** | ACME\_network\_default\_ipv4\_subnet  |
| **Subnet ID**     | fbe19c26-08f5-493a-8dd1-eaa888f9f12a  |
| **Target CIDR**   | 10.10.10.0/24 (EasyStack destination) |

3. **Run Migration** ‚Üí Selected latest restore point ‚Üí Executed migration.
4. Migrated VM appeared under **OpenStack Instances**.

---

## 3. Conclusion

This migration demonstrated the complete workflow of moving a workload from Oracle VirtualBox to EasyStack using Hystax.

Key steps included:

* Preparing the web server.
* Configuring NAT and port forwarding.
* Verifying application delivery via Nginx.
* Setting up the Linux kernel for replication.

The migration process was completed successfully, with the VM appearing as an instance in EasyStack.

‚ö†Ô∏è The custom HTML file did not replicate due to an environment-specific baremetal error. However, since the **primary objective was to validate the migration procedure itself**, the task was achieved as planned.
