# Glossary

### Oracle VirtualBox

Oracle VirtualBox is an open-source virtualization platform that enables users to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. In this project, VirtualBox was used as the source environment for the workload.

### EasyStack

EasyStack is a cloud computing platform built on OpenStack that provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). It served as the target environment for the migrated workload.

### Hystax

Hystax is a cloud migration and disaster recovery solution that automates the process of replicating workloads from one environment to another. In this case, Hystax was used to migrate the virtual machine from VirtualBox to EasyStack.

### Cloud Migration

Cloud migration is the process of moving applications, data, or workloads from an on-premises environment, such as VirtualBox, to a cloud platform, such as EasyStack. The goal is typically to improve scalability, resilience, and operational efficiency.

### NAT (Network Address Translation) and Port Forwarding

NAT with port forwarding is a networking configuration used in VirtualBox to allow access to a virtual machine from the host system. NAT manages the mapping of private IP addresses to public addresses, while port forwarding ensures that external traffic is directed to the correct service within the virtual machine.
